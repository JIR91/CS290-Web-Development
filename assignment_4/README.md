Assignment 4 (continuation of assignment 3)

Assignment 3's website was used as a skeleton to implement more CSS properties (to further satisfy assignment 3 grade requirements) in assignment 4's website, and includes a ".js" file with some Javascript implementation.

Current State: Links to subpages work exept Login tab when px < 1040 (might have to check on that), when px > 1040 Login dropdown appears, in dropdown "create accout" uses JS to open "login.html".

Current Goal: Using js to get the dropdown to remain visible when user clicks on text box, clicking outside of ".dropdown-login" colapses dropdown, if possible. Once or if I move on, I'll continue on to create function in JS to take/read/modify username and password given after user selects 'LOGIN' button.
