5 websites with aspects that you either like or dislike (such as good or poor layout, presentation of or overload of  information, easy or hard to navigate, 
loads quickly or slowly considering the data on the page, fun or frustrating, flashy or boring, cute or dreadful, great or poor interactivity, whatever else you
might think of!)

- Google's results page, regardless of what's searched, the page is always left-aligned. I believe it appear more elegent if it was centered.
- LBCC's login opens to many tabs to reach our destination. I would like to know why and could it be modified so that user simple enters username and password
information, and loads on the same tab.
- Canvas's course's navigation menu is at an odd location. The 3-horizontal, as a user means a hiden menu is there, should be relocated at top-right instead of
top-left.
- W3school's website is will organized, just a clicks can get the user to the turorial/documentation.
- I am amazed at Amazon's loading time on their main page, recently they added live sales feed on top of everything that is load on the main page.
