5 websites with aspects that you either like or dislike (such as good or poor layout, presentation of or overload of information, easy or hard to navigate, loads quickly or slowly considering the data on the page, fun or frustrating, flashy or boring, cute or dreadful, great or poor interactivity, whatever else you might think of!)

1. Google's results page (https://www.google.com/), regardless of what's searched, the page is always left-aligned. I believe it would be more elegent if it was centered.
2. LBCC's login procedure (https://www.linnbenton.edu/) opens to many tabs to reach our destination. I would like to know why and could it be modified so that user simple enters username and password information, and loads on the same tab.
3. Canvas's course's navigation menu (https://canvas.instructure.com/login/canvas) is at an odd location (upper-left). The 3-horizontal, as a user means a hiden menu is there, should be relocated at top-right instead of top-left.
4. W3school's website is will organized (https://www.w3schools.com/), just a clicks can get the user to the turorial/documentation.
5. I am amazed at Amazon's loading time on their main page (https://www.amazon.com/), recently they added live sales feed on top of everything that is load on the main page.

A link to the site and what you like or dislike and ways that you think each of the 5 websites might be improved

1. https://www.google.com/: Dislike how much data their algorithm collects from users.
2. https://www.linnbenton.edu/: The search bar on the page tends to be unreliable at time or the results are unorganized, would expect the top most link to be what the user is searching for.
3. https://canvas.instructure.com/login/canvas: Beside the location of the course navigation menu, I like the layout of the page and believe it's very user friendly.
4. https://www.w3schools.com/: Hands-down the best (personal opinion) website to learn the basics of multiple languages.
5. https://www.amazon.com/: Love and hate the site. Love because I can shop at my onvinience, but hate how easily they gather all the varies items onto one page while incorparating similiar items; an affective stratagy to sell anything.
